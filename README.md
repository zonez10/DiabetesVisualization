**Data Visualization Web App for Diabetes Dataset**

Description

This project is a data-driven web application that focuses on visualizing key attributes of a diabetes dataset. The dataset includes information such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and an outcome indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

Features

Correlation Heatmap: Explore the correlation between different attributes of the dataset through an interactive heatmap. The color-coded representation helps identify relationships and dependencies among variables.

Scatter Plot: Visualize the relationship between age and glucose levels with a scatter plot. The plot is color-coded based on the diabetes outcome, providing insights into how these factors may contribute to diabetes.

Technologies Used

Backend: Python with Flask framework
Data Visualization: Plotly Express for creating interactive and informative visualizations
Styling: Bootstrap for a clean and attractive user interface
